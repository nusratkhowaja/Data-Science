# Data-Driven Brand Strategy for a Cycle Share Scheme

## Objective

The objective of this project is to determine the brand persona for a new cycle sharing scheme in Seattle. By understanding the customer base, we aim to develop targeted marketing strategies to improve customer retention and attract new users.

## Scenario

The cycle sharing scheme offers a convenient, affordable, and environmentally friendly transportation option within the city. Currently, it operates with 500 bikes at 50 stations. Users can choose between an annual membership offering quick access and unlimited 45-minute rentals, or short-term passes granting access for 24 hours or 3 days. Bikes can be picked up and returned at any station citywide.

## Questions and Assumptions

1. **Assumption:** Short-term pass holders are likely to be new users testing the service.
   - **Question:** How can marketing strategies be tailored to convert short-term pass holders into long-term members?

2. **Assumption:** Millennial customers are more likely to be loyal to brands they like.
   - **Question:** How can the cycle share scheme capitalize on this loyalty to increase customer retention and attract new millennial users?

3. **Assumption:** Trip duration and frequency may vary based on factors such as user demographics, subscription type, and station location.
   - **Question:** How can these variations be used to segment customers and personalize marketing efforts?

4. **Assumption:** Understanding the seasonality of trip frequency and duration can help optimize operational and marketing strategies.
   - **Question:** How can the cycle share scheme adjust pricing or promotions to align with peak usage periods?

5. **Assumption:** Outliers in trip duration data may skew the mean and impact analysis.
   - **Question:** How can the impact of outliers be minimized to provide a more accurate representation of typical trip durations?

6. **Assumption:** There may be correlations between certain user characteristics (e.g., age, gender) and trip behavior.
   - **Question:** How can these correlations be leveraged to tailor marketing messages and offerings to specific user segments?

## Data and Analysis

We utilized a dataset containing transaction history information from the cycle sharing scheme. The analysis included univariate and multivariate analyses, correlation analysis, and time series analysis to understand user behavior and demographics.

## Conclusion

Based on the analysis, we concluded that targeted marketing strategies can improve customer retention and attract new users. By understanding user behavior and demographics, the cycle share scheme can develop effective marketing strategies.
